# Curvascope
Curvascope is an open-source online viewer for hyperbolic regular tilings.  Curvascope is built
using React, with ThreeJS/WebGL for rendering and realtime, and Ant Design for the UI. It produces
hyperbolic tiling images by means of iterated circle inversions and Euclidean reflections based on
Coxeter groups.
